        We aim to ensure that all displaced or deprived children and youth complete a full cycle of basic education and provided them with opportunities for post-primary education such as technical and vocational education and training, agricultural training, financial inclusion and dependence and tertiary educational opportunities. We promote and support the inclusion of IDP and refugee children and youth into formal education systems, so they can benefit from an accredited education that allows them to progress through all levels of the education system.
