        A positive outcome from a health care intervention results in a broad reduction of the severity and frequencies of illnesses for affected persons, including decreasing threats to their well-being, reducing their vulnerabilities, and increasing their capacities. This is achieved through changes in behaviour, attitudes, policies, knowledge, and practices on the part of relevant stakeholders.
