        TLCC livelihood intervention cut across providing employment support to individuals and households by way of providing technical skills, social networks, practical experience and supporting, access to physical, natural, and financial productive assets such as natural resources, tools and equipment that will help them effectively access agricultural and non-agricultural labour markets, either through wage employment or self-employment. This is aimed at building secure and resilient livelihoods and climb out of poverty permanently. We also collaborate with partners to build sustainable employment opportunities for vulnerable populations through business support, by means of working with micro, small, and medium businesses (MSMEs) that are starting up or scaling up their activities and by working with individual employers to ensure that the work opportunities that are available are decent and sustainable.
